# CBMDS
The Python function `CBMDS_JMR2008` in this package implements the **Cluster Bilinear Multidimensional Scaling** (CBMDS) method proposed by **DeSarbo, Grewal, and Scott (2008)**. This method simultaneously conducts customer segmentation and product positioning based on preference rating data collected from customer reviews. Refer to the example to learn how to use this function.
